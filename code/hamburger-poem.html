<p class='sectionhead'>Hamburger Poem</p>
<p class='poemstanza'>Yesterday I was eating at McDonald's and got to thinking. </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>I was looking at old pictures on my phone and trying to remember where I took them. And I was thinking about hamburgers. </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>It's impossible to remember every McDonald’s hamburger you’ve ever eaten. But if every McDonald's hamburger is basically identical, then a memory of every past hamburger is accessed by the experience of eating a new one.  </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>Think of it like looking at a picture someone else took of the house you grew up in. A McDonald's hamburger is holding on to your memories for you, waiting for you to eat them again. </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>I wrote some of this down in a notebook as I ate my hamburger. </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>Some people say that McDonald's hamburgers aren't real food, that they won't ever decompose, that they're manufactured out of chemicals rather than cooked from organic matter. But as far as I can tell, my body digests them just fine. </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>Still, the thing about the hamburgers not decomposing is probably true. It's basically a proven fact at this point. </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>You can actually watch the last McDonald’s hamburger sold in Iceland, now over a decade old, not decompose in real time on a webcam. </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>McDonald’s closed all its stores in Iceland in 2009, but the last hamburger sold in the country was never eaten. The guy who bought it kept it to see if it was going to decompose or not. It was displayed in a museum for a while. Now it’s on the internet.</p>
<p class='poemstanza'>The colors are a little faded, but the now-famous hamburger is still perfectly hamburger-shaped, sitting in a glass-and-wood display case next to a dusty carton of fries. All things considered, it looks great.</p>
<p class='poemstanza'>I watched the hamburger on my phone screen yesterday as I ate. Nothing at all was happening to it: the seconds on the timestamp just clicked up, up, up. </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>We know what happens to organic matter when left to its own devices for long enough: it stinks, gets carpeted in fuzzy mold, and flesh-eating bacteria chew it up. It dies and goes away. </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>Are the billions and billions of hamburgers served by McDonald's not made of organic matter?</p>
<p class='poemstanza'>McDonald's denies, of course, that their hamburgers exist outside the circle of life. They say their food will rot as well as any corpse if you give it the right conditions and enough time. </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>Only a lack of moisture in its display enclosure, McDonald's says, separates the famous, still-pristine hamburger from the rankest hunk of highway carrion.</p>
<p class='poemstanza'>I say this is marketing gold and they should lean into it: McDonald's has conquered death! </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>Other restaurants sell you recycled flesh on the brink of disappearing into oblivion. McDonald’s has the technology to give you a product that will outlive the earth itself!</p>
<p class='poemstanza'>Our human bodies are puny in comparison to a McDonald's hamburger. After a while we shrivel up and stink and death starts licking its lips. When the fuzzy mold and flesh-eating bacteria move in, it's game over. </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>McDonald's grins at the glint of death's sickle and asks if it wants fries with that. </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>We people forget to water our plants, pretend we remember a walk across the Danube a decade ago. We forget our parents' birthdays. </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>McDonald's straddles the rainbow bridge between heaven and earth, laughing in the face of memory as it carves eternal hamburger galaxies into the stony cosmos.</p>
<p class='poemstanza'>I say: good on them. </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>After all, wouldn't Van Gogh's flowers still look nice in the paintings if he had used a plastic model instead of a real, stinky bouquet? Who can tell the difference, centuries later, when the ink is dry?</p>
<p class='poemstanza'>Why does something have to be able to die to be beautiful? </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>Can't we admit it would be better if we never forgot anything? </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>I want to defeat death and memory just like McDonald's. I take lots of pictures. I try to write down everything I hear, and a lot of what I think. </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>Even now, though, looking back at my old notes, they seem like nonsense to me, like someone else wrote them. I don’t recognize some of the people in the pictures. </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>Last weekend, for example, I took a trip to Budapest. I had been there before, one teenaged summer, but nothing looked familiar this second time around. I had taken pictures, kept a journal, and this couldn’t have been much more than a decade ago. It was starting to get on my nerves.</p>
<p class='poemstanza'>Suddenly, coming up the steps to a castle plaza, it hit me: I've been to this place before! I took a picture through those arches!</p>
<p class='poemstanza'>Still, everything else had rotted away in my memory. Despite all my efforts, only this tiny fragment was left. And no matter how many pictures I take, notes I write, or hamburgers I eat, any future weekends in Budapest will one day disappear too. </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>For that reason I believe the last McDonald's hamburger in Iceland will eventually decompose back into the chemicals from which it was manufactured. </p>
<p class='poemstanza'>But I will keep writing things down just in case. </p>
